# code-to-essay
The library essay is a code generator from a readme file but this library is a reverse operation.

## Inspiration
I used `eassy` and made a simple project that can generate many code files of javascript (ES7). That can create a good document because you can update code and docs in the same time. I would like to create a converter from code files structure into readme. It will be also created by `essay` after convert them.

## Getting started
  0. Install this library

  ```
  npm i -g code-to-essay
  ```

  1. Write a pathname with prefix `c2e:` in your README.md

  ```
  c2e:src/main.js
  ```

  2. Convert them with command
  ```
  c2e build
  ```

  3. Setting your project follow `essay` format ([https://github.com/dtinth/essay](https://github.com/dtinth/essay))


*Now, the project could be generated by `essay`.*
