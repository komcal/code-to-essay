# code-to-essay
The library essay is a code generator from a readme file but this library is a revert operation.

## Inspiration
I used `eassy` and made a simple project that can generate many code files of javascript (ES7). That can create a good document because you can update code and docs in the same time. I would like to create a converter from code files structure into readme. It will be also created by `essay` after convert them.
